# admin-dashboard
After my first try with this challenge, I was not satisfied with the outcome. To my taste I utilized too much Flexbox in my previous design. This time I want to focus mainly on CSS Grid as a tool.

# Update and result
So this was really bit of a challenge to me. Grid didn't let me get through this with ease. However, the result looks and fells allright to me. There are still some elements that I would like to redo but for now I've spent enough time with this project. Surely I'll 
revisit my code and this challenge again.
